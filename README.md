  <li><strong>Data Cleaning and Transformation:</strong> The project involves cleaning and transforming data to ensure accuracy, consistency, and readiness for analysis. This includes handling duplicates, missing values, and data consistency issues.</li>
  <li><strong>Interactive Dashboards:</strong> We leverage PowerBI to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards and reports that provide valuable insights into sales performance. These dashboards include charts, graphs, and tables.</li>
  <li><strong>Advanced Analytics:</strong> SQL is used to perform advanced analytics on sales data, extracting actionable insights to drive improvements in sales strategies and operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Real-time Access:</strong> The solution allows management to access up-to-date dashboards and reports in real-time, enabling data-driven decision-making.</li>
</ul>
